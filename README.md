# MobenixFixer
Fixes HDR and some other stuff on a GMod map "gm_mobenix_v3_final".

Server-side only! You must ask the server owner or admin with access to the server codebase to add it to a server with a Mobenix map.

### What does it fix?:
* Adds the missing tonemap controller. Now the map will no longer burn your eyes.
* Disables dynamic shadows on prop_door_rotating's.
* Disables the annoying Easter egg sounds.

### TODO:
* Find a way to properly disable Wire Door Controller dynamic shadows.
